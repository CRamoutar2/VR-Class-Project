This pack is designed to help you build terrains for your game. It contains heightmap data that is presented in several different formats, along with some sample 4K terrain textures. Using these assets you can get started straight away using our prebuilt Terrains or us can use these terrains a stamps to procedurally generate new terrains with tools such as Gaia, MapMagic, Atlas and Vista. We also provide brushes so that you can manually paint new terrains.

You will find:

1.	Scenes folder – containing two demo scenes for each terrain/heightmap, one textured, one untextured.
2.	TerrainData – containing the raw terrain data files (textured and untextured) as well as the texture layers used. 
3.	Textures – The Diffuse and Normal textures for the sample texture layers
4.	Heightmaps – EXR format heightmap textures 
5.	Brushes – Preconfigured brushes for stamping your terrains with Unity’s Terrain Tools

See the PDF in the root of the asset folder (next to this README) for more information.
